COMP20 - Web Programming
Assignment 3: Where in the World Is...

Project tests knowledge of parsing JSON, using AJAX, using google maps API, and practice with exception handling.

Correctly Implemented:
  - Map loaded to screen.
  - Redline T Stations rendered on screen with T logo as marker logos.
  - Red polyline rendered between each station.
  - Each T station has a 'onclick' event listener, which brings up an infowindow.
  - Locations for Waldo and Carmen found via AJAX.
    - Exceptions for finding both, one, or none added. Can handle all cases.
  - Rendered Waldo and Carmen icons in their proper locations.
  - User's location found and displayed on map.
  - Distances to Waldo and Carmen Sandiego displayed when you click on their icon on the map.
  - Closest T Station to user's location displayed when you click one the user's marker.

Incorrectly/Not Implemented:
  - Train schedule in infowindow for each stop

Help Received:
  - Stackoverflow and w3

Hours Spent:
  - Approximately 8-10.
     - Most time spent researching how to do things with google maps API and AJAX.

Other notes:
  - I wasn't entirely sure what to do about Carmen and Waldo if they did not appear on the screen...
    so I opted to print to console if they did not appear.
