Comp20 - Assignment 6 Notes:

How to find vulnerabilities:
 - Can find any tool
   - Fuzzers, etc.

Don't just say "The application has an XSS vulnerability" -- SHOW how you came
to that conclusion.

Show steps about how you broke the code.

Do not go to teammates heroku app on heroku; break it locally.

Vulnerabilities:
 - Asterisks (regular expressions) -- look for 'em
