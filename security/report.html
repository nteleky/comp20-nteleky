            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>"Mao Gaming Industries" is attempting to create a single Scorecenter API that can be responsible for managing high scores
            for all its games and users. The API should work with games that use GET/POST requests, should be able to find high scores
            for each game, and should keep track of users and dates.</p>
            <p>10:43 Security Analysts has been hired to assess the security of this API. This is especially important to keep users
            from posting their own fake scores (to boost their ratings), possibly hacking into the mainframe of the gaming site, or even
            trying to bring the score center servers down. Before the API goes live (and is hooked up to Mao Gaming Industries' recreation
            of Frogger), they have hired us to be certain of Scorecenter's security, and make changes to the API based on our suggestions. 
            This is an overview of the security leaks found and recommendations to increase the security of this API.

        <div class='section' id='methodology'>
            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>To test the security of this application, 10:43 Security followed standard protocol in assessing security from each possible
            angle, starting with a download of the source code and a local test. We first logged in as a user would, and went through each
            possible function (viewing all scores, viewing high scores via JSON, posting scores into the database, and searching for usernames
            to find highscores for usernames. We then assessed vulnerability to basic attacks, such as changing the database structure, 
            changing internal database information, uploading large files, and submitting many requests. The main tool that was used when
            carrying out this analysis was <a href='http://www.portswigger.net/burp/'>Burp Suite</a>.The source code was then thoroughly
            analyzed to uncover further security leaks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='section' id='abstract'>
            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>The main problems found dealt with the insecure qualities of the database (this ScoreCenter uses MongoDB which, while a NoSQL DB, 
            still needs to be protected from attacks involving huge amounts of requests) and the ability of any user to both post anything into
            the database or into the HTML pages via userinput text boxes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='section' id='issues'>
            <h1>Issues</h1>
        <ol>
            <li class='issue'>
            No User Authentication
            <ul>
                <li><h1>Location:</h1> web.js </li>
                <li><h1>Severity:</h1> <span id='high'>HIGH</span> - Anyone can access API and submit to the scorecenter database (anything from scores to malicious code to large files) </li>
                <li><h1>Description:</h1> As it stands now, anyone can post to the Scorecenter database, without requiring a verification that
                the user or game using the API is valid/allowed to do this. As a result, any random game or person could write code to post
                their own scores/information into the database. This also means that, if launched, a user not affliated with Mao Gaming could
                add fake high score information, boosting their rating on the site. This destroys the integrity of the Scorecenter and means 
                that scores posted may not be authentic. </li>
                <li><h1>Resolution:</h1> An API key (which would secure the API to use only for those with the key)
                might make the most sense. This would mean that only games/users with the API key could post into the scorecenter.
                If the goal is for this Scorecenter to be widely used, then creating specific API accounts might also be something
                to consider (something similar to Apple's GameCenter, which has users create accounts to confirm they have access). </li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li class='issue'>
            No Usersearch Input Validation
            <ul>
                <li><h1>Location:</h1> web.js, usersearch.html </li>
                <li><h1>Severity:</h1> <span id='high'>HIGH</span> - Users can be bombarded with popups, taken to phishing sites, or otherwise harmed.
                </li>
                <li><h1>Description:</h1> When a user goes to search for the highest scores by a certain username, they do it through a single
                text-input window, which then returns a page containing the results for that username. Once that input is received, however, it
                is not sanitized, and can take <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags and <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tags. This allows one to send malicious
                javascript into the page that will actually be executed. Most notably, if a malicious user were to create a username containing
                malicious scripts, everytime that user was searched for, the malicious code could be executed. Using a tool like Burp Suite, the
                parameters for the search could be changed, allowing the database to be altered. To confirm, we injected the usersearch
                with html and javascript. The result is pictured below. <br><img class='screenshot' src='images/trollfacehack.png'></li>
                <li><h1>Resolution:</h1> This could be solved in several ways. (1.) All user input should be sanitized with a function that pulls
                apart html characters (a javascript-equivalent for php's htmlentities(), perhaps?), then should be checked against the original input.
                If there are differences, then the user may have been injecting scripts into the form. (2.) If scripts have been found in a search,
                a function should grab the user's IP address (and possibly black-list it), the time, and any other identifying information to
                make system admins aware of the attack.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li class='issue'>
            No Limit to Number of Requests
            <ul>
                <li><h1>Location:</h1> web.js </li>
                <li><h1>Severity:</h1> <span id='medium'>Medium</span> - With a scripting language, an experienced hacker could
                pound the server with thousands of requests in a short amount of time in an attempt
                to crash the whole API.</li>
                <li><h1>Description:</h1> After viewing sourcecode, we determined that it would be possible to write a script that 
                created several thousand POST requests in just a few minutes. After attempting this, we were able to fill the database
                with a lot of useless information (a new database was created for the purposes of this test so that it could be deleted),
                which, if put online and hosted by real servers, could be enough to bring down the database, or the entire app.</li>
                <li><h1>Resolution:</h1> In the 'submit' section, have a check for IP address and other identifying information to make sure
                that a bot (or a scripting program) isn't pounding the server with useless requests in an attempt to bring it down. For example,
                perhaps after 5 requests in a timeframe of 10-20 seconds, don't allow any more post requests for some time. This would prevent
                scripting programs from loading and filling the database.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

        </ol>

        <div class='section' id='conclusion'>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>There are several security leaks in this ScoreCenter API as it stands now, allowing outside random users to overwrite, delete, or insert information. 
            With that capability, the site itself could be attacked to change layout and
            capabilities, costing money to fix and ultimately making it difficult for users to use properly.</p>
            <p>Based on the changes and severity of the flaws found, it is recommended that you hire 10:43 Security Analysts
            to review and fix this API. Based on the analysis, these issues could be fixed for approximately $100.00.
            For an extra $100.00, 10:43 Security could also build a more secure platform for the site or 
            improve the security of heroku with several add-ons, to make this app more secure and available for public use.</p>
