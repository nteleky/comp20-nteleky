This repository is for Comp20: Web Programming at Tufts University, Spring 2013.

My favorite project was Assignment 3 - the MBTA rail map. This is also the project
I'm most proud of.

Throughout this course, I've become a stronger programmer and learned many of the
standards for web programming that I can now use in the real world. This has been
an excellent course.
