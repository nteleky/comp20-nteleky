COMP20 - Lab 7/8 - Job Listings:

**At this point, I have figured out how to parse the JSON string and pull data
from it, but I still have no idea how to properly format it or get it into the
HTML at all. I feel like I'm missing one key part that's just not clicking
with how DOM and JSON work together/what functions to use. Notably, I'm having
issues with newlines. HELP! **
