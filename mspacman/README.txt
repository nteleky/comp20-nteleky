Lab 6: Ms. Pac-Man
Feb 14, 2012
Programmer: Nick Teleky


 -- All parts of Lab 6 correctly implemented. Google PacMan board renders with
 a Ms. PacMan in the center, being chased by a blue ghost. All images are
 rendered from the one given sprite image.

 Time to implement: About 2 hours (most of that time spent looking up functions
 and finding dimensions within the sprite image).
