Heroku link:

* The MongoDB has been filled with a few sample scores/usernames.
* Currently, so as to not use up dyno hours, web processes have been turned off. They can be turned on if you'd prefer though.

Implemented Correctly:
--------------------
* MongoDB and Node.js working properly with heroku
* Usersearch - search users and return results for just that user.
* POST and GET APIs - work as expected when tested via terminal.
* JSON implementation working properly

Implemented Incorrectly:
--------------------------
* Sort -- was having trouble with the sort method.

Note: There is little to no formatting in this project... ran out of time
to make it pretty.

Hours spent: Approximately 15
